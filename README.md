Love is what makes the world a better place. Love can make you happy. Love can you make you believe. Love can make you become the best version of yourself. 

I made this mandala art to represent how I live my life. The pink blossom at the focal point of my work symbolizes that I let love become the center of my life. With love, you can make a lot of things possible. The green leaf that surrounds the pink blossom represents peacefulness. I chose peacefulness for I believe that when there is love, there is peace.
